        <p>Dear Sophie,</p>
        <p>I want to say happy birthday to you. As you usher in a new year and a new era, I want to wish you all all the best. Knowing you
            has been one of the best things to ever happen to me. Your friendship has been one of the best things I am experiencing in my life 
            and I am really glad I met you. In life, you really don't know the things you deserve and need, and I never knew I needed a friendship like 
            yours but now I can't fathom the thought of losing you. It started off like friendship but slowly and steadily I fell for you and became in 
            love with you and day by day this love has continued to grow. I came to care about you more than I can ever tell you or show you. Fuck, sorry
            for the cursing this isn't supposed to be a poorly written love letter rather a birthday wish.
            I hope this year only brings you good tidings and may the sun, moon, and stars illuminate your path. May the Lord guide you and bestow blessings
            on you each and every day and may all your dreams and wishes come true and may you accomplish all your goals for you deserve it.
            May the Lord grant you all your prayers and may our friendship and love grow and foster. May this chapter be filled with wins upon wins upon wins.
            May happiness ensue you and may you get all your heart's desires. I am not much of a writer but may you get all that you deserve and grow into your 
            best self. May this year be ensued with great memories that you will treasure and you be happy.
            I love you and HAVE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY. TO MORE LIFE, LOVE AND LAUGHTER. HAVE A BLESSED DAY MAMAA.
        </p>
