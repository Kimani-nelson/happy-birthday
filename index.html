Knowing you has been one of the best things to ever happen to me. Your friendship has been one of the best things I am experiencing in my life and I am really glad I met you. In life, you really don't know the things you deserve and need, and I never knew I needed a friendship like yours but now I can't fathom the thought of losing you,For I know its one that happens once in a lifetime...It started off like friendship but slowly and steadily I fell for you and became in love with you and day by day this love has continued to grow. I came to care about you more than I can ever tell you or show you. Fuck, sorry for the cursing this isn't supposed to be a poorly written love letter rather a birthday wish.On this day a queen was born and I would like nooo love to celebrate her.Your presence in my life has been a force of love friendship that I have clme to rely on.Without knowing you have brought smile and happiness that I never knew I would find.In you i was lucky to find a magnificent woman whom I'd love to know more and more each day... to say for a lifetime would be an understatement because even in the next life I'd love to know you... I know I'm alot to handle but boy am I glad that you put up with me and that alone I will forever cherish you mamii to forget me is easy but you choose to put up with me no amount of words are enough to do you justice... your beauty illuminates my world your laughter brightens my day and your kindness just makes me happy and warms me.Everyday I get to spend with you is a blessing and every moment is just magnificent and magical... you always challenge me to be a better person and in every turn I say goodbye I always look forward to when I will see you next for when I'm with you I turn into my best version I know all this may sound silly and childish but thats just the truth. so let me take this moment to celebrate you mamaa...
